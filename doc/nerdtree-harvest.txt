INTRODUCITON                                          *nerdtree-harvest-intro*

NERD Tree Harvest is a plugin which adds mappings to the |NERDTree| directory
browser to "harvest" file paths by yanking to registers or to ex or shell
command lines.  Four mappings are created, `y` `Y` `.` `!`, each of which
reads one or more additional characters to determine a modification to the
path.  Modifiers are based on |filename-modifiers| and summarized in the
following table.
>
  Key | Name      | Modification
  --- | --------- | ------------
  `.` | relative  | `:.` File path from current working directory
  `~` | home      | `:~` File path from home directory, or absolute
  `p` | absolute  | `:p` Absolute path from filesystem root
  `h` | head      | `:h` Path without the last component (parent directory)
  `t` | tail      | `:t` Final path component (file name)
  `r` | root      | `:t:r` Tail with last extension removed (`/a/b.c` -> `b`)
  `e` | extension | `:e` Last extension of the file name (`/a/b.c` -> `c`)
  `:` | modifier  | `:` Arbitrary modifier, type enter to end e.g. `:~:h<CR>`
  `?` | help      | Echo a list of modifiers, continue reading next one

MAPPINGS                                           *nerdtree-harvest-mappings*

The following mappings are added to |NERDTree| buffers. |Yank| mappings accept
|registers| as a prefix and default to the unnamed register. Pressing `?`
after the first character of a mapping will show available modifier keys.

*nerdtree-harvest-y* *nerdtree-harvest-yank*

`y` mappings yank the modified path into the given register |characterwise|,
overwriting the current register contents.
>
  y.  Yank the relative file path
  y~  Yank the file path relative to your home directory
  yp  Yank the absolute path from the filesystem root
  yh  Yank the parent directory's path
  yt  Yank the final path component, i.e. the file name
  yr  Yank the final path component, with its last extension removed
  ye  Yank the last extension of the file
  y:  Enter additional |filename-modifiers| keys, end with <CR>
  y?  Show a list of modifiers, continue reading
<

*nerdtree-harvest-Y* *nerdtree-harvest-Yank*

`Y` mappings yank the modified path into the given register |linewise|,
appending to the current register contents. `Y` can thus be used to collect
several files of interest from the tree and later pasted into a buffer.
>
  Y.  Yank the relative file path
  Y~  Yank the file path relative to your home directory
  Yp  Yank the absolute path from the filesystem root
  Yh  Yank the parent directory's path
  Yt  Yank the final path component, i.e. the file name
  Yr  Yank the final path component, with its last extension removed
  Ye  Yank the last extension of the file
  Y:  Enter additional |filename-modifiers| keys, end with <CR>
  Y?  Show a list of modifiers, continue reading
<

*nerdtree-harvest-.* *nerdtree-harvest-command*

`.` mappings start an Ex command (|:|) with the escaped, modified path and
move the cursor to the beginning of the command.
>
  ..  Ex command with the relative file path
  .~  Ex command with the file path relative to your home directory
  .p  Ex command with the absolute path from the filesystem root
  .h  Ex command with the parent directory's path
  .t  Ex command with the final path component, i.e. the file name
  .r  Ex command with the final path component, with last extension removed
  .e  Ex command with the last extension of the file
  .:  Enter additional |filename-modifiers| keys, end with <CR>
  .?  Show a list of modifiers, continue reading
<

*nerdtree-harvest-!* *nerdtree-harvest-shell*

`!` mappings start a Shell command (|:!|) with the quoted, escaped, modified
path and move cursor to the beginning of the command.
>
  !.  Shell command with the relative file path
  !~  Shell command with the file path relative to your home directory
  !p  Shell command with the absolute path from the filesystem root
  !h  Shell command with the parent directory's path
  !t  Shell command with the final path component, i.e. the file name
  !r  Shell command with the final path component, with last extension removed
  !e  Shell command with the last extension of the file
  !:  Enter additional |filename-modifiers| keys, end with <CR>
  !?  Show a list of modifiers, continue reading
