# NERD Tree Harvest

This is a Vim plugin that adds several ways to "harvest" file paths from the
[NERD Tree directory browser](https://github.com/perservim/nerdtree).

## Yank Mappings

When NERD Tree is active, use one of this plugin's mappings to yank a form of
the path to the currently selected file or directory. The key bindings are based
on the characters used in `:help filename-modifiers`. For example, `yh` yanks
the path to the file's parent directory, much as `:cd %:h` changes the current
directory to the parent of the file in the current buffer.

Key  | Name              | Path Modification
---- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------
`y.` | yank relative     | `:.` File path from `$PWD`
`y~` | yank from homedir | `:~` File path from `$HOME`
`yp` | yank absolute     | `:p` Absolute path from root
`yh` | yank head         | `:h` Parent directory path
`yt` | yank tail         | `:t` Final path component (filename)
`yr` | yank root         | `:t:r` Filename with last extension removed
`ye` | yank extension    | `:e` Last extension of filename

The yank mappings currently harvest paths into the default register (`"`) and
can thus be inserted into another buffer with the `p` command or `CTRL-R = "`.
TODO: add support for designating a named register.

## Command Mappings

There are also mappings which harvest a path to the end of a command, inspired
by the [vinegar plugin](https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar). These start a
command with `:` (Ex) or `:!` (shell), append the path, then move the cursor to
the beginning of the command, making it easy to operate on the selected file or
directory.

### Ex

```
: path/to/file
 â†‘ cursor is here
```

Key  | Name                 | Path Modification
---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------
`..` | command relative     | `:.` File path from `$PWD`
`.~` | command from homedir | `:~` File path from `$HOME`
`.p` | command absolute     | `:p` Absolute path from root
`.h` | command head         | `:h` Parent directory path
`.t` | command tail         | `:t` Final path component (filename)
`.r` | command root         | `:t:r` Filename with last extension removed
`.e` | command extension    | `:e` Last extension of filename

### Shell

```
:! path/to/file
  â†‘ cursor is here
```

Key  | Name               | Path Modification
---- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------
`!.` | shell relative     | `:.` File path from `$PWD`
`!~` | shell from homedir | `:~` File path from `$HOME`
`!p` | shell absolute     | `:p` Absolute path from root
`!h` | shell head         | `:h` Parent directory path
`!t` | shell tail         | `:t` Final path component (filename)
`!r` | shell root         | `:t:r` Filename with last extension removed
`!e` | shell extension    | `:e` Last extension of filename
