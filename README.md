# NERD Tree Harvest

This is a Vim plugin that adds several ways to "harvest" file paths from the
[NERD Tree directory browser](https://github.com/perservim/nerdtree).

## Yank Mappings

When NERD Tree is active, use one of this plugin's mappings to yank a modified
form of the selected path from the directory tree. The key bindings are based on
the characters used in `:help file name-modifiers`. For example, `yh` yanks the
path to the file's parent directory, much as `:cd %:h` changes the current
directory to the parent of the file in the current buffer.

Key  | Name              | Path Modification
---- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------
`y.` | yank relative     | `:.` File path from `$PWD`
`y~` | yank from homedir | `:~` File path from `$HOME`
`yp` | yank absolute     | `:p` Absolute path from root
`yh` | yank head         | `:h` Parent directory path
`yt` | yank tail         | `:t` Final path component (file name)
`yr` | yank root         | `:t:r` File name with last extension removed
`ye` | yank extension    | `:e` Last extension of file name

The yank mappings currently harvest paths into the default register (`"`) and
can thus be inserted into another buffer with the `p` command or `CTRL-R = "`.
TODO: add support for designating a named register.

## Command Mappings

There are also mappings which harvest a tree path to the end of a command,
inspired by the [vinegar plugin](https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar). These
start a command with `:` (Ex) or `:!` (shell), append the path, then move the
cursor to the beginning of the command, making it easy to operate on the
selected file or directory.

### Ex

```
: path/to/file
 â†‘ cursor is here
```

Key  | Name                    | Path Modification
---- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------
`..` | ex command relative     | `:.` File path from `$PWD`
`.~` | ex command from homedir | `:~` File path from `$HOME`
`.p` | ex command absolute     | `:p` Absolute path from root
`.h` | ex command head         | `:h` Parent directory path
`.t` | ex command tail         | `:t` Final path component (file name)
`.r` | ex command root         | `:t:r` File name with last extension removed
`.e` | ex command extension    | `:e` Last extension of file name

### Shell

```
:! path/to/file
  â†‘ cursor is here
```

Key  | Name               | Path Modification
---- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------
`!.` | shell relative     | `:.` File path from `$PWD`
`!~` | shell from homedir | `:~` File path from `$HOME`
`!p` | shell absolute     | `:p` Absolute path from root
`!h` | shell head         | `:h` Parent directory path
`!t` | shell tail         | `:t` Final path component (file name)
`!r` | shell root         | `:t:r` File name with last extension removed
`!e` | shell extension    | `:e` Last extension of file name
