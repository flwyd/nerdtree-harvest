" @section Introduciton, intro
" @order intro mappings
" NERD Tree Harvest is a plugin which adds mappings to the |NERDTree| directory
" browser to "harvest" file paths by yanking to registers or to ex or shell
" command lines.  Four mappings are created, `y` `Y` `.` `!`, each of which
" reads one or more additional characters to determine a modification to the
" path.  Modifiers are based on |filename-modifiers| and summarized in the
" following table. >
"   Key | Name      | Modification
"   --- | --------- | ------------
"   `.` | relative  | `:.` File path from current working directory
"   `~` | home      | `:~` File path from home directory, or absolute
"   `p` | absolute  | `:p` Absolute path from filesystem root
"   `h` | head      | `:h` Path without the last component (parent directory)
"   `t` | tail      | `:t` Final path component (file name)
"   `r` | root      | `:t:r` Tail with last extension removed (`/a/b.c` -> `b`)
"   `e` | extension | `:e` Last extension of the file name (`/a/b.c` -> `c`)
"   `:` | modifier  | `:` Arbitrary modifier, type enter to end e.g. `:~:h<CR>`
"   `?` | help      | Echo a list of modifiers, continue reading next one

" @section Mappings, mappings
" The following mappings are added to |NERDTree| buffers. |Yank| mappings accept
" |registers| as a prefix and default to the unnamed register. Pressing `?`
" after the first character of a mapping will show available modifier keys.
"
" *nerdtree-harvest-y* *nerdtree-harvest-yank*
"
" `y` mappings yank the modified path into the given register |characterwise|,
" overwriting the current register contents. >
"   y.  Yank the relative file path
"   y~  Yank the file path relative to your home directory
"   yp  Yank the absolute path from the filesystem root
"   yh  Yank the parent directory's path
"   yt  Yank the final path component, i.e. the file name
"   yr  Yank the final path component, with its last extension removed
"   ye  Yank the last extension of the file
"   y:  Enter additional |filename-modifiers| keys, end with <CR>
"   y?  Show a list of modifiers, continue reading
" <
"
" *nerdtree-harvest-Y* *nerdtree-harvest-Yank*
"
" `Y` mappings yank the modified path into the given register |linewise|,
" appending to the current register contents. `Y` can thus be used to collect
" several files of interest from the tree and later pasted into a buffer. >
"   Y.  Yank the relative file path
"   Y~  Yank the file path relative to your home directory
"   Yp  Yank the absolute path from the filesystem root
"   Yh  Yank the parent directory's path
"   Yt  Yank the final path component, i.e. the file name
"   Yr  Yank the final path component, with its last extension removed
"   Ye  Yank the last extension of the file
"   Y:  Enter additional |filename-modifiers| keys, end with <CR>
"   Y?  Show a list of modifiers, continue reading
" <
"
" *nerdtree-harvest-.* *nerdtree-harvest-command*
"
" `.` mappings start an Ex command (|:|) with the escaped, modified path and
" move the cursor to the beginning of the command. >
"   ..  Ex command with the relative file path
"   .~  Ex command with the file path relative to your home directory
"   .p  Ex command with the absolute path from the filesystem root
"   .h  Ex command with the parent directory's path
"   .t  Ex command with the final path component, i.e. the file name
"   .r  Ex command with the final path component, with last extension removed
"   .e  Ex command with the last extension of the file
"   .:  Enter additional |filename-modifiers| keys, end with <CR>
"   .?  Show a list of modifiers, continue reading
" <
"
" *nerdtree-harvest-!* *nerdtree-harvest-shell*
"
" `!` mappings start a Shell command (|:!|) with the quoted, escaped, modified
" path and move cursor to the beginning of the command. >
"   !.  Shell command with the relative file path
"   !~  Shell command with the file path relative to your home directory
"   !p  Shell command with the absolute path from the filesystem root
"   !h  Shell command with the parent directory's path
"   !t  Shell command with the final path component, i.e. the file name
"   !r  Shell command with the final path component, with last extension removed
"   !e  Shell command with the last extension of the file
"   !:  Enter additional |filename-modifiers| keys, end with <CR>
"   !?  Show a list of modifiers, continue reading
